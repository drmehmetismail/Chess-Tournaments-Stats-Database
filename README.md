# Chess Tournaments Analyses with Stockfish

Feel free to use the scripts at https://github.com/drmehmetismail/Quick-Game-Intelligence-for-Chess or https://github.com/drmehmetismail/World-Chess-Championships to calculate game intelligence (GI) score, missed points, and many other metrics.

1 missed point = making a losing blunder in a winning position. 0.5 missed points = making a losing blunder in a drawn position, or drawing blunder in a winning position. 0 missed points = perfect play.

## Sesse
Special thanks go to Steinar (https://sesse.net/), the owner of the well-known chess computer Sesse, who kindly agreed to share with me detailed raw data for all analyzed moves up to and including December 31, 2024. Under the 'Sesse' folder, I have merged this data into a more user-friendly PGN format. An analysis of these games can be found in the same folder.
