# Chess Tournaments Analyses with Stockfish

Feel free to use the scripts at https://github.com/drmehmetismail/Quick-Game-Intelligence-for-Chess or https://github.com/drmehmetismail/World-Chess-Championships to calculate game intelligence (GI) score, missed points, and many other metrics.

1 missed point = making a losing blunder in a winning position. 0.5 missed points = making a losing blunder in a drawn position, or drawing blunder in a winning position. 0 missed points = perfect play.
